The total training dataset entered was 8628 datapoints. This resulted in We use strided convolutions in 51768 datapoints after utilising all three cameras and augmenting the dataset. Data collected in training mode include three camera images matched with steering angle, throttle, brake and speed. Data is gathered by manually driving the simulated vehicle.

As a result of this natural left turn bias, we horizontally flipped each image and corresponding steering angle (i.e. multiply by -1).

The images below demonstrate normal and flipped images from the center (top), left (middle) and right (bottom) cameras.\n",

In track 1, there are no center lane lines and it is not a realistic driving scenario. In addition to training a seperate CNN for steering angle predictions, we also trained another to predict speed. From this, we ran `drive_new.py` with two CNNs working simultaneously. The velocity predictions are used to infer throttle and braking predictions. The video for this is shown below. There was one instance where we were required to interven manually towards the end of the track. With more time we would introduce random brightness and alternative image transforming techniques to better generalise the model. We feel that this could fix this problem. The results work best for \"fast\" resolution. \n",

The vehicle worked very well on track 2 also besides one sharp turn the vehicle failed to make. However, if we addedd additional training data focused on that point, the vehicle would have traversed track 2 perfectly."
